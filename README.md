Bulls And Cows Game Simulator

-Introduction
  Bulls And Cows is a classic code-breaking game in which the player has to guess a secret code of n numbers.
  The game is played by guessing a combination of numbers and then receiving feedback in the form of "bulls" and "cows".
  A "bull" means that a correct number is in the correct position, while a "cow" means that a correct number is in the wrong position.
  The player has to use the feedback to refine their guesses until they correctly guess the secret code.

  This project is a Bulls And Cows game simulator that allows the user to choose the number of digits in the secret code and the number of games to simulate.
  The computer will use an efficient algorithm to simulate the games and provide statistics on the number of attempts required to solve each game.
